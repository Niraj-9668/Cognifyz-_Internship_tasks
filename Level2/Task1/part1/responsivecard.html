        The 718 family welcomes new members: with the new 718 Spyder and the 718 Cayman GT4, Porsche is launching two
        particularly emotive and powerful flagship models to claim top spot in the 718 model line-up. Their purist
        character will appeal to sports car enthusiasts who delight in unadulterated driving pleasure and appreciate a
        high level of agility as well as an almost intimate proximity to the centre of power. The perfectly balanced
        mid-engined layout offers all this. For the first time ever, the 718 Spyder and the 718 Cayman GT4 share a
        technically identical base. This includes the newly developed four-litre six-cylinder naturally aspirated
        engine, together with a six-speed manual gearbox. The boxer engine generates 309 kW (420 PS) in both models.
        While the GT4 represents the entry-level GT road car from Porsche, the Spyder lends itself to all kinds of
        curves. Both rely on highly efficient aerodynamics, a full GT chassis and powerful brakes.

        At the heart of both models is the new four-litre six-cylinder boxer engine. The naturally aspirated engine is
        based on the same engine family as the turbocharged motors in the current 911 Carrera model series. The new
        high-revving powerplant generates 309 kW (420 PS) â€“ 35 PS more than the previous GT4 had. The third generation
        of the Spyder has 45 PS more than its predecessor. Peak torque of 420 newton metres arrives between 5,000 and
        6,800 rpm. Both sports cars are equipped with manual gearboxes and are capable of breaking the 300 km/h barrier.
        The 718 Spyder has a top speed of 301 km/h, while the 718 Cayman GT4 can reach 304 km/h, and both accelerate
        from 0-100 km/h in 4.4 seconds. The combined fuel consumption of the mid-engined sports cars is 10.9 l/100 km
        according to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The enthralling character of this naturally aspirated engine
        combines a modern gasoline particulate filter emission control system with the linear power delivery and the
        immediate response of a GT engine. It has a maximum engine speed of 8,000 rpm and the unparalleled boxer sound
        remains untouched. New additions include technical highlights such as a start-stop function and adaptive
        cylinder control. In part-load operation, it temporarily interrupts the injection process in one of the two
        cylinder banks, thus reducing fuel consumption.

        Piezo injectors are used for direct fuel injection for the first time ever in a high-revving engine. They split
        each injection process into up to five individual injections. This supports a complete, and therefore
        emissions-friendly, combustion process. A variable intake system with two resonance valves ensures optimum gas
        exchange in the cylinders.
